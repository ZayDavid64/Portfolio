    <div class="bar"></div>
    <p>I am a Frontend Web Developer who has a deep love for experiencing and learning new ideas, 
        concepts, and technology.
        That is what attracted me to Web Development,
        I am determined to continue to expand my knowledge and understanding so as to use my skills to positively impact those that I have the opportunity to work with. </p>

        <h4>Skills & Technologies:</h4>
        <p> HTML | CSS | Javascript | React | Debugging | Networking | Git | Github | Object-oriented programming</p>
        <p>I always have had a love for tech ever since I was young.
            The first language I ever taught myself was Python,
            so that I could use the text editor in Adobe After Effects to make
            proceduralized special effects in my videos.
